Dear Ms. Clothier,

I am writing to apply for the position of IT Specialist. My Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology and four years of experience constructing, managing, and improving computer networks makes me a solid candidate for your organization.

My professional experience includes developing and managing the day-to-day operations of the internal network at Grey Technologies. I am certified in several IT languages, including Ruby and Perl C++. I think I can be a great asset at Silver Technologies with my education and set of skills.

Here are my most relevant skills and accomplishments:

Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology from Stanford University
Developed and implemented infrastructure inspection plan to assure network quality
Installed and hardwired hardware and infrastructure upgrades
Performed regular network security checks and updates
Analyzed network KPIs and regularly presented findings to non-technical stakeholders
Surely you’ll come across candidates with similar qualifications, but I think what sets me apart is my adaptability. I pride myself on being able to wear many IT hats and using my skills to meet the ever-changing needs of the organization. If you are interested in learning more about how I can be an asset to Silver Technologies, then I’d be happy to schedule an interview. Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Ben M. Groth
